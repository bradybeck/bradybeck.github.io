                        I was raised on a family farm in the Wayne Township of Jones County, Iowa.  Officially my address was Scotch Grove but I attended school in Monticello.  “The Grove” – both a reference to the town and the local watering hole – barely sustained a post office and grocery at that time, much less a school.  My family still farms there.  During my years on the farm we produced corn, soybeans, and hogs.  We had cattle until the mid-1980s but I cannot recall much of that other than claiming for my own “#88” and being very sad as I watched her load into the trailer headed for the auction barn.  The hog operation was expanded over time to include two state-of-the-art (at that time) farrow-to-finish confinement buildings in addition to the open lots and pasture systems.

                        I cannot claim to have hands-on experience with crop production, livestock or hogs but I suppose you learn a lot about agriculture just being around it all:  at the dinner table listening to Dad’s conversations with the “commodities guy”, helping Mom fix the lunches and deliver them to the fields during planting and harvest, in the tractor while Dad grinds corn for the pigs, and eavesdropping on the quarterly accounting and stockholder meetings.  For me, memories of life on the farm include walking beans, husking sweet corn, 4-H horse shows, tooling around the gravel roads and creeks by horseback or bike (or amphibious 6-wheeler if we caught Dad at the right time), watching as the “candy truck” dumped rejected candy bars into the hog lot (yes, really), being assigned caretaker of the litter runts so they didn’t get squashed or eaten, and Tractor Day at school.  From my perspective, there is no better way to grow up than on a farm…but I am biased.

                        After high school I attended Kirkwood Community College (1992-1994) and then Coe College (1994-1996), both in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Kirkwood is where I took my first course in economics and I remember well that “light bulb” moment when things became clear…economics made sense of things in a way appealing to me and I decided it was something I should stick with.  My econ professors at Coe really wanted me to go to graduate school but I was engaged to be married just weeks after graduation and so I accepted a grain merchandising position with ADM.  My professors were not happy with this but it was a decision that would serve me well.  Working for ADM taught me about basis, hedging, commodity markets, and the processor side of the market.  It also paved the way for a move to the securities market and my eventual realization that I wanted to somehow get back to the agricultural side of things, and that I wasn’t ready to hang up my student hat just yet.

I had a great time from 1996 through 2001 and more addresses than most in my family bothered to jot down in their address books.  I suppose if there are any years in your life to be careless and adventurous, they are the 20s.  I dappled in bungee jumping and skydiving and spent most weekends on the water or pursuing another adventure.  Mom and Dad reminded me that it was a darn good thing I was paying for my own health insurance and that I ought to tone it down because life insurance doesn’t pay out if you die while skydiving.  I think my family worried that I was never going to settle down and get serious.

                        Back to that student hat…  I must admit, the choice to enter graduate school was made about one day after receiving a layoff notice and measly severance package option from a large securities firm. It was just the push for change that I needed.  Beginning in 2001, I spent two years at the University of Central Florida and then moved to Raleigh after being accepted to the Economics Graduate Program at North Carolina State University. It was there that I had the fantastic fortune to be assigned as a research assistant to Wally Thurman.  I was there too long and cannot say that my experiences there were that of a typical graduate student.  Still, I made it out (thanks to Wally, Michele Marra and a host of other mentors.) and managed to land a job (also thanks to Wally, et al.) in 2010 at the place I had long professed to want to end up.  Being a faculty member in the Department of Economics at Iowa State University was my pipe dream, and it happened!  I am fortunate to be surrounded by nationally-renowned colleagues, an impressive web of extension, outreach, and research programs, and am in a locale at the forefront of agriculture.

                        Aside from the serious business of research, teaching, and extension, my affinity for adventure remains…albeit toned down a bit from younger years.  My summers are usually filled with cycling with friends on TOMRV, RAGBRAI and weekly rides, training for various “running” events (my pace is more like a jog), and weekend concerts.  Each year the Great Jones County Fair in my hometown is a must-do, but it’s been a while since I’ve been back to enjoy it.
