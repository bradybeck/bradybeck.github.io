## the problem.

  We've all been there. Sitting in a public place and then enters a screaming kid. Nasty thoughts start crawling into the picture - would someone please get that kid out of there. Most of the time the thoughts are aimed more so at the parent. *I can't believe that parent let's their kid get away with that. I will never be like that*. We ever get on airplanes and pray that we don't get placed by a screaming baby.

  Weddings are a common place to be adult only, you can come celebrate but please leave your monsters at home.

  I understand the logic. When I'm out with my kids and I'm talking to you, I apologize right now but I'm 50% listening to you if that because I'm making sure that my kid's not running out of the fire escape or putting stray chicken nuggets in his mouth.
